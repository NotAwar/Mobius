Mobius is a modern, API-first Mobile Device Management (MDM) platform designed for self-hosted environments. It provides comprehensive device management, policy enforcement, and application distribution across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android devices.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Start the API Server

```bash
# Build and run the API server
cd server/api
go build -o mobius-api ./cmd/api-server/
./mobius-api
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8081` with these default credentials:

- **Email**: `admin@mobius.local`  
- **Password**: `admin123`

### Test the API

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/health

# Login and get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@mobius.local","password":"admin123"}'

# Check license status
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/license/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Architecture Overview

Mobius follows a clean, API-first architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## Products

### Mobius Server (`mobius-server/`)

The core backend server that provides:

- **Device Management**: osquery orchestration and MDM protocols
- **REST API**: Complete API for device management operations
- **Web Interface**: Admin GUI is a separate React app that talks to the API
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning and compliance monitoring
- **Multi-tenancy**: Team-based device organization

**Target Environment**: Deployed on servers/cloud infrastructure

### Mobius CLI (`mobius-cli/`)

Command-line interface for:

- **Configuration Management**: GitOps-style device policy management
- **Server Administration**: Remote server management
- **Data Analysis**: Query execution and data export
- **Automation**: Scripting and integration support

**Target Environment**: Administrator workstations and CI/CD pipelines

### Shared Libraries (`shared/`)

Common utilities used by both products:

- Certificate management
- HTTP client libraries  
- File operations
- Cryptographic utilities

## Installation & Usage

Each product can be built and deployed independently:

```bash
# Build server
cd mobius-server && go build -o ../build/mobius ./cmd/mobius

# Build CLI  
cd mobius-cli && go build -o ../build/mobiuscli ./cmd/mobiuscli
```

## Development

The products are designed with clear separation:

- **Server**: Handles device connections, data storage, and management logic
- **CLI**: Provides administrative interface and automation capabilities
- **Shared**: Common code that both products depend on

This structure enables:

- Independent releases and versioning
- Clear product boundaries
- Focused development teams
- Simplified deployment scenarios
